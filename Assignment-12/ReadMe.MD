  What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?

    Padding is the space between an elements content and its border. Padding can be applied to all sides of an element or to a specific side.

    Margin is the space outside of the elements border. This can be used to add space between elements. It can also be applied to all sides of the element.

    Borders are lines and boundaries that surround the element. They are used in a visual way to seperate one element from another. You can design borders however you want them to be displayed.

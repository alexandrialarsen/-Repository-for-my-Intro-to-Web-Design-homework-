Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
Universal Selector: The universal selector targets all elements on a webpage. When using this selector, all styles will be applied to all elements on the webpage.
Element Selector: The element selector targets all instances of a particular HTML tag. When using this selector, only specific types of elements will have the styles applied.
Class Selector: The class selector targets all elements with a specific class attribute. For example, when writing this code, we used inspiration, and to select and style this element, we used ".inspiration". This type of selector will target these specific groups.
ID Selector: The ID selector targets a single element with a specific ID attribute. You would use this type of selector when you are wanting to apply an element to an individual element/part of the code.
Depending on how specific you would want the selector to be, would dictate which selector you would chose to use. When deciding, you would consider if you want an individual element to be selected, a group of elements, or the code as a whole.

Discuss your color palette. How did you choose your colors?
I chose my palette based on the colors I saw in the sunset. I used the purple color from the example you had gave us because I realized that I saw this color in the clouds of the sky in my picture as well. I also tried to bring out the oranges and its harsh contrast with the blue of the water. Yet, is matched well with the pinks in the picture.

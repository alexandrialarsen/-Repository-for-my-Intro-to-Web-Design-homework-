What is an affordance?
An affordance is something that defines/makes it clear on how something on a page should be used. 
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a third-party service like YouTube or Vimeo to host your videos?
Third party hosting or service is ideal for video and audio files, can host large quality versions of files, and can handle compatibility, encoding, and other details necessary for a variety of browers, and this doesn't require any work from you. Third party options are not ideal for image files, any unlicenced materials used without permission can be crawled and reported, and can become costly to upgrade storage or services. 
Optional: What challenges did you face this week with this assignment? How did you overcome them?
I could not get my image to input properly or get the color background the same as you did in your video. I think I figured it out thought, but if there is still an issue with it I would love to know.
